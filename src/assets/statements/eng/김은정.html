<p>A Piece of My Heart</p>
<p>What kind of person am I? What is my ego like? What would it be like
to visualize my ego? This work is intended to pursue such a
conception.</p>
<p>Pondering ways to express my ego, I wrote a few personal notes in my
diary to find the answers. Reading my writings closely, I discovered
that I recently was longing for the past very much. So, I started to
express my feelings from past objects in color. Pieces expressed in
color come together to form a self-portrait.</p>
<p>The screen - My Face - is divided into 13 canvases, each of which is
also made up of small pieces. So, when looking at the artwork up close,
it is a color abstraction work of several colored pieces, but when
viewed as a whole from a distance, the existence of myself becomes
visible. Pieces of my past come together to become my inner self, that
is, myself.</p>
<p>Also, each canvas is given a theme according to the size. The bigger
the size, the bigger part of my past it occupies, and how much I think
of it has a lot of influence on my current self. The keywords of each
theme are some selected 100 keywords which were carefully selected from
another pool of 250 keywords that summarize the things that I felt
special about through photos, videos, places, etc. of the past. The
selected keywords are classified according to the themes of the canvas.
After the classification, the pieces are filled with colors that come to
mind when I think of the respective keywords. Sometimes, several colors
come to mind at the same time from one keyword. The color extracted this
way becomes a piece on the mosaic self-portrait. And I add contours to
the various objects from my past using diluted inks and watercolors on
thin traditional Korean paper. After that, it is cut or torn and then
glued to the colored pieces as if the drawings were permeated on the
surface.</p>
<p>Leaving strong impressions, past experiences evoke special feelings
in the present me. The fragments of my emotions from the past amalgamate
into my inner self at present. The bigger me here and now is made up of
the numerous tiny and diverse things of my past.</p>
