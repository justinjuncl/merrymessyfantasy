<p><em>"Everything that disappears leaves a trace. The question is what
remains when everything is gone.</em></p>
<p><em>Therefore, we can think that everything that has disappeared
continues to live secretly and exert an insidious influence."</em></p>
<p>Jang Baudrillar <em>[Pourquoi tout n'a-t-il pas deja
disparu?]</em></p>
<p>Old buildings and vacant lots that disappear quickly ... Buildings
that are built high as if their mushrooming overnight would cause them
to enter unfamiliar spaces. Within a few years, the landscape of the
neighborhood that has been viewed for 15 years in the name of new city
development is changing day by day. The alleys, which used to be a
little dirty and winding, have been replaced with straight roads, and
the low hills where trees and vines lived in tangles have turned into a
forest of huge buildings. The fear of unfamiliarity felt in a familiar
space is now transforming into a landscape that can only be seen in any
city through an uncanny state.</p>
<p><strong>I am now experiencing Uncanny Valley.</strong></p>
<p>The act of compulsory viewing of a situation (at least I am), the
space like the facade of a theater, and the city after Uncanny Valley
approaching with a sense of loss ... I can't just beautifully record a
proliferating city in a pattern of repeated circulation. Sometimes 00
times and sometimes 00 times (still undecided) I try to continue my work
by accumulating cities and spaces.</p>

<p>What is this ...</p>
<p>I began to raise questions right here.</p>
<p>Since then, I have a fear that my daily life may collapse.</p>
<p>This fear refers not to the fear of not knowing the future, but to
the fear of knowing.</p>
<p>Knowing the situation that will come to me is identical to the fear
(of chasing) of what is slowly approaching.</p>
<p>Pet bottles, plastic bags, disposable items ... The migration of
civilizations built to be clean and convenient, on the contrary, erodes
our daily lives. Climate warming, disease, starvation, and forest
fires... It is a huge price that came back after removing daily
inconvenience. Now you have to face discomfort. You have to stay in the
negative.</p>
<p><strong>So that fear becomes fear.</strong></p>
<p>This is not a solution to a problem, but a fear of not being aware of
the sense of fear that we should remain in us.</p>
