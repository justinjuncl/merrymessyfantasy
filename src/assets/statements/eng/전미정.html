<p>Those were the days when I dug deep into the face of a person</p>
<p>in front of a mirror.</p>
<p>Beautiful, and even daunting,</p>
<p>I was disgusted, feeling nauseous</p>
<p>from double-edged desires and feelings,</p>
<p>understanding their contradictions and coexistence.</p>
<p>I looked in the mirror</p>
<p>with a stricken look.</p>
<p>If the visibles</p>
<p>and the invisibles</p>
<p>torment me</p>
<p>I would breathe onto the mirror</p>
<p>erasing the visibles</p>
<p>and with a blunt finger</p>
<p>I drew the invisibles in detail.</p>
<p>Every time the air cools,</p>
<p>the breath disappeared quickly,</p>
<p>and the stricken face became clear again.</p>
<p>Transparent lines stacked on the mirror</p>
<p>creating a different expression.</p>
<p>I wanted to have them -</p>
<p>a transparent mind</p>
<p>and diverse complexions.</p>
