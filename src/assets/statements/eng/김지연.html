<p>1.</p>
<p>A small hut made of pillows by a little child,</p>
<p>The body of a tortoise with its head and four legs hidden,</p>
<p>A blanket covering head to toe to avoid the winter cold,</p>
<p>When something painful happens,</p>
<p>I crouch my body.</p>
<p>When I want to cry,</p>
<p>I lock the door to my room and hold my breath in a corner.</p>
<p>Isolating myself from the outside, separating the space where I
am.</p>
<p>Like a tortoise pulling its head into its shell,</p>
<p>I hide just like that.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>The act of confining myself yields security.</p>
<p>The isolated space separates me from the painful reality.</p>
<p>It will lead me to the paradise I have found from where I have
fled.</p>
<p>Life is not kind, and I am ready to run away.</p>
<p>Disconnected from the reality,</p>
<p>let me find comfort in a space of my own without any suffering.</p>
<p>Let me run farther away.</p>
<p>To a place where the reality cannot find me.</p>
<p>To Seocheon.</p>
