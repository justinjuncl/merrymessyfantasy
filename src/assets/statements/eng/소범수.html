<p>Many processes in everyday life are overshadowed by results. Complex
emotions change uniformly as soon as they reach the result, and they
disappear in an instant with a sigh that the process is over. My work is
to see many of the processes of my daily life again. I want to say that
the processes in everyday life that I and we went through were not
insignificant. Our daily lives are colorful because they are complex,
enjoyable because they are incomprehensible, and brilliant because they
are strange. I get immensely fascinated by the unusually brief moments
gained from this ordinary life.</p>
<p>I start my daily work collecting brief everyday thoughts that feel
like scenes from my dreams and moving them on to a viewing screen. And
create a new story by adding different images to the gathered images as
if to play flower arrangements. The subjects expressed as if they were a
collage of thin photos are devices that convey that the daily variation
I imagined was a moment, and the thick and accidental flow of paint
reminds that these images were actually still cut in moving
daily-video.</p>
<p>The past daily life and the feelings we experienced in the process
are never understood and remain only an abstract piece and photograph in
a moment.</p>
<p>My work is the emotions that lived with me, and the processes that
were not just trivial to lead to the wonderful results that will come
someday in the future.</p>
