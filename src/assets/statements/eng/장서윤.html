<p>I often have bizarre, wayward dreams that really don’t make sense at
all. But even if the dreams don’t add up, they somehow oddly comfort me.
I pour those dreams out onto my canvas so that I can experience the
feelings once again.</p>
<p>The viewers look at the texture and colors of the painting.</p>
<p>When looking at it from a distance,When looking up close,Thoughts
that occur to the viewers’ minds are not much different from what I had
when I first encountered them in my dream. What is this situation? What
is going on? How did I end up here? What did she draw? The self in my
dream cannot answer those questions. Dreams reconstruct the spaces and
shapes by transforming all my emotions, including prejudices, anxieties,
fears, jealousy, love, hatred, interests, affection, and expectations.So
many different emotions and events get mixed up and then discharged in
dreams.Paradoxically, in dreams, where there is no clear answer, we find
clues to our daily lives. Therefore, I think, dreams are the perfect
material of my art for me to realize on my canvas.</p>
