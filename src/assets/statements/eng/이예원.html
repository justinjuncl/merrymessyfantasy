<p>The Gray Years</p>
<p>Dreams uncover without notice memories that have been underlying our
    consciousness. When I see a rare scene or place in my dream, I endeavor
    to find out where it came from. Wouldn't a seemingly random dream be
    actually screened through some kind of algorithm? I thought I could find
    a clue if I recorded my dream. <em>The Gray Years</em> started just like
    that. It is a record of my black-and-white dreams – blurry, foggy, and
    ambiguous.</p>
<p><em>The Gray Years</em> expanded gradually from a picture that
    started with a small panel. The panels were not drawn chronologically or
    in a sequence. They were arranged to connect with each other according
    to their contents. They widened their gaps and stuck to each other in
    repetition, creating a shape like an island. And the island keeps
    changing its shape.</p>
<p>I think that being completely awake is white, a shallow sleep is
    gray, and a deep sleep is black. White and black are clear and direct.
    On the other hand, the gray in the middle is not clear in the continuum
    of colors. The pencil was suitable for expressing this ambiguous gray
    color.</p>
<p>Every time the intense feeling in my dream gradually fades away, I
    keep reflecting on it. Pencils are similar. If I sharpen a pencil and
    draw a picture with it, it becomes thicker and spreads easily. Then I
    sharpen the pencil again to describe clearly remembered parts. While
    drawing, the part rubbed with the palm was left as rubbed. Just as
    dreams do not flow as I wish, I leave some marks accidentally.</p>
<p>Dreams cannot be fully shared like a sunset seen alone on a deserted
    island. I imagine dreams happening within a big algorithm that I have
    never seen. I also imagine finding a new society in a dream that seems
    extremely personal through the algorithm.</p>

<p>나는 연필과 종이의 질감을 손으로 만져보고, 엉성하게 기억나는 부분은
    지워버리고 뭉개버렸다. 모든 선을 지우고 나면 가장 깊은 선만이 선명하게
    남는다.</p>
<p>꿈과 현실에 영향을 주는 것은 감정이다.</p>
<p>또렷했던 꿈의 기억은 그림을 그리다 보면 점점 흐려지고 흔적만
    남는다.</p>
<p>I touch the texture of the pencil and paper with my hands, erase and
    crush the vaguely remembered parts.</p>
<p>After all the lines are erased, only the deepest lines remain
    clear.</p>
<p>It is emotions that affect dreams and reality.</p>
<p>The clear memories of dreams gradually fade away and only leave
    traces as you draw them.</p>
