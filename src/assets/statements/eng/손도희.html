<p><strong>“Commodities are no longer defined by their use, but rather
by what they signify.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>- French philosopher, Jean Baudrillard &lt;La Société de
Consommation(1970)&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The meaning of economic exchange, purchasing and selling
commodities, has expanded in modern times. Today, it includes "the
behavior of producing and consuming symbols." Beyond the optimistic or
pessimistic perspective, whether we agree with it or criticize it, now
is the era when the terms of production and consumption overlaps the
concept of communication.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here we face two unfamiliar facts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. The concepts of production and consumption signify
communication.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Although people produce and consume materials, what they
are actually producing and consuming are symbols.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This artwork, the project ‘SELL YOUR MIND’, visualizes
various original ideas (thoughts, opinions, and emotions) written in
short writings. The next version of this project would be in the form of
a shopping mall that enables producing and purchasing the ideas that are
visualized just like this first version of the project.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wouldn’t you join in the buying and selling of the
idea-symbols?</strong></p>
