<p>I wondered if writing can have the same power that spoken words have
when people communicate through language. Words that exist in the
auditory world are dynamic, personal, and emotional. It has the power to
express the dynamics and delicacy of human emotions. The moment you try
to put those words onto paper, the power is lost and volatilized. It is
replaced by just a combination of some twenty abstracted shapes.</p>
<p>The infinite dimensions of human speech cannot be captured with the
11,172 letters that can be theoretically combined in Hangul. It is
because speech includes both verbal and nonverbal expressions. I
wondered how the letters could possess the "power" of words obtained
from nonverbal rhythms and tones, and whether the visual world could be
as rich in communication as the auditory world. I felt the need for a
new writing system different from the existing ones, and my work is an
attempt to explore such a system.</p>
<p>As humans began to use awls on stones, from brushes, pens, and
pencils, to typewriters, and keyboards, and in modern times, speech
recognition technology, our tools for writing have evolved ever since.
But our letters have been much the same since old times. My writing
system, which was born suitable to use the interface of modern
technology, is a departure from traditional writing systems. The new
letters are phonetic scripts that nonverbal and verbal language are
melted into. The accompanied computer system analyzes human sounds and
implements a linguistic model so that it can draw infinite characters.
Since all the subtle nuances intended through human speech are expressed
with strokes, the number of the characters cannot be limited.</p>
<p>My work consists of several experiments, works, and records. The
first expression experiment &lt;Abide, Break&gt; is a work using ink. In
the experiment, I captured my spontaneous emotional state and emerging
thoughts into three letters. These abstract-looking letters depict the
high-resolution expressiveness that my new writing system pursues. It is
said that traditional East Asian ink has the power to contain all the
universe and matter. Using that power as a tool, I drew letters that
became prototypes of the new writing system.</p>
<p>We learned our “abcde” when we were young. There is an infinite
number of sounds between “ah” and "uh", but how would we write them? The
letter map series depict a map of the infinite character space of my
writing system. Letters in a similar space on the map have a similar
sound and thus have a similar shape. Walk along the map, and one will
notice there exists a variation of sounds and letters. Just as it is
difficult to quantify one’s emotions, moods, and attitudes, it is
difficult to express exactly where my letters are distributed, so I
borrow a virtual coordinate system to express them.</p>
<p>The memory experiment &lt;Speak in Blockchain&gt; is a work created
using the characteristic that the writing system is still incomplete. It
is a time capsule of sorts that contains my words in this very period
before graduation, like the flow of my unconscious mind, thoughts and
concerns that are difficult to openly express. It's for when I want to
come back and reread my thoughts in the distant future. My thoughts and
feelings vaporized in the past, but they remain in my writing. I've
built a device that draws these letters, but I haven't yet built a
device to read it out loud. Naturally, it takes an enormous amount of
effort and time for my writing system and device to be completed, and
the day when I can interpret this text will come. This work encourages
the exhibition visitors to decipher my writings, and I hope that they
will find the lost past me also.</p>
<p>My character system lacks interpretability. It is possible to
distinguish different nuances with slightly different strokes, but it's
difficult to understand exactly what they sound like. This is one of the
challenges to solve to advance the writing system. Lastly, what I
prepared for the exhibition is a documentary work for the audience to
understand the progress of the creation of my writing system. This work
notes will give you a glimpse into the process of exploring this writing
system and preparing for my graduation exhibition, and you'll have a
device where you can see the letters that are generated when it receives
your voice.</p>
