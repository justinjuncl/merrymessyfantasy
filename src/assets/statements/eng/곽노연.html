<p>It is said that there are two kinds of people: when faced with a
painful challenge in their daily life, those who run away from it and
those who confront it with dignity.</p>
<p>In order to escape from a nightmare, one must know that it is just a
dream. To wake up from the nightmare one needs to realize it. The
hardships of reality, which cannot be escaped by waking up like a dream,
are frightening. No matter how many times one opens her eyes, the
reality is still there.</p>
<p>There are no clear answers in reality. No explanations, nor
interpretations. I tried to get advice from books and conversations.
Don't get caught up in fear, but keep your eyes open and just face the
challenge.</p>
<p>It takes courage to confront a problem.</p>
<p>It takes more courage to face the dark and the unknown.</p>
<p>Having the courage to face one another - that is the beginning.</p>
<p>Your own fears are not the same as the fears of others.</p>
<p>The opposite is also true.</p>
<p>May you feel courage to face the 'something' that you have to
confront, may you empathize by putting yourself in it and see pain and
hope inside it.</p>
<p>May you feel the courage to see ‘that something’ that you have to
face. Put yourself into ‘that something’, emphasize with it, and see
hopes as well as pains in it.</p>
