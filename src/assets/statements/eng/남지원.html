<p>When I tell others about the things that make me happy, I often find
myself showing them a part of me.</p>
<p>I met a stray cat at the Whanki Museum. Even though I am afraid of
cats, I always “meow” at them and pretend to be a fellow feline. But
that day at the museum, the cat came upon me and sat quietly on top of
my foot. It was warm. I felt the weight. My mom, who was also afraid of
animals, made a fuss telling me to stay away as I was beginning to
develop a feeling of bonding with the creature. From that day on, I grew
fond of cats.</p>

<p>While taking a stroll in the neighborhood with my sister and mom, we
entered a café that I had been eyeing for a long time. Now the place is
my regular hangout. Drinks are served in nice vintage teacups at this
brown-toned place. My mom and sister order drip coffee, and I, not a
coffee drinker, order milk tea. Chilling out sitting on a brown chair
and chattering about little things makes my heart brighter.</p>

<p>Everyone has happy moments. As for me, those moments are when
something happens to come into my mind, when I spend time with the
people I love. Even ordinary things have lovely meanings and remain as
memories. The scene where I was happy to meet a little squirrel at an
arboretum in Paju (which simply could not be captured in a painting),
the image of myself looking at a pine tree standing behind the temple on
the first day I went to Jin-gwansa, the image of my mother carefully
picking a stone and placing it on top of a stone tower and making a
wish, the double cherry blossoms in full bloom at Beartree Park, and the
persimmon tree on the road I stared at for a long time – they all seem
to be fleeting right before my eyes.</p>
