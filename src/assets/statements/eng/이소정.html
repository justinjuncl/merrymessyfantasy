<p>Styrofoam buoys are detrimental to the marine ecosystem and are no
longer in public use. This is because small Styrofoam particles
decompose and fall off, polluting the seawater, and sea organisms that
mistake them for food try to swallow them. In seaside towns, however,
there are buoys that have been swept up by the tidal waves. No form is
perfect, and they have been occupied by barnacles and mussels or partly
eroded away. Fishermen reuse these old Styrofoam buoys. There is no
owner, only an exchange of them between a beach and another, and they
simply use what the ocean gives them.</p>
<p>Buoys float on the sea and play the role of memory. They inform us
that something lives in a depth that cannot be reached from our sight
and marks a place in the vast sea so that we can return to it. A buoy
drifts off from the raft they were tied to and starts wandering. Then,
when it is swept up to land with the push of a big wave, it is tied back
with ropes and released into the sea by a fisherman who recognizes its
function. No matter how much the Styrofoam is decomposed, even if only a
small piece is left, it still floats on the water just the same.</p>
<p>Styrofoam buoys that seem disposable may be used for longer than we
imagine, perhaps for ever. Eternal existence may not only be for those
who have immortality from the beginning, but also for those who, when
forgotten, regain their new place and live on without losing their role
in the world. Things do exist that survive every crisis of extinction. I
dress these Styrofoam buoys in hemp and ottchill, wishing upon them
immortality and allowing the barnacles and seashells to live on for
ever.</p>
