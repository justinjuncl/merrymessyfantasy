<p>Human beings are eternally alone, but they cannot live humanly
without getting together with their surroundings. This proposition has
two underlying assumptions. First, you should listen to and understand
the inner voice of what you want and don't want. Also, you should think
about ways to reveal it and finally get along and mix with the outside
world.</p>
<p>There are times when certain thoughts that arose within me arrive
outside safely. Half-bloomed flowers, dregs left out of place, and
bundles of shyness hiding under the veil â€“ all try to breathe a new
breath clumsily.</p>
<p>However, the words from my mind are chewed up so much that they lose
their original form, and nothing is engraved on the place where the
sunken heart is turned down. The thoughts that have not arrived in the
end turn into residues and remain there. Lives with their own
heartbeats, damp and lukewarm, get intertwined and draw a tranquil
scenery at a very slow pace.</p>
