<p>I express the world I see through a doll named Carol. Carol projects
the image of myself. Because Carol is someone like a news reporter who
realizes my thoughts, she is a plastic medium without a soul and
expressions. Together with Carol, I ponder and solve everyday problems.
As such, my work is like a period of growth that contains various traces
of life and worries that I encounter in my ordinary everyday life.</p>
<p>The world Carol wants to show in this graduation exhibition is the
world of children. I mainly worked on the thoughts I had while I was
teaching children English as a side job. As we grew up, our thoughts
became increasingly complex and insecure, and by projecting onto Carol
the anxiety created from our changing thoughts, I show the discrepancy
between childhood and society. I want to work on the anxiety of getting
to know the world little by little from the perspective of children.</p>
<p>Carol's ambiguous and uneasy expression in the painting or the
overall uneasy atmosphere of the painting is like the fear of taking the
first steps into society. (Being independent from the protections that
parents and many other things provide.) But Carol also has an innocent,
bright heart and happy memories even in that tension. I hope that heart
will not be hurt, but Carol's future still has the anxiety of growing up
as an adult in reality. Carol, a plastic doll, is shaped like a human on
the outside, but after all, she is not human. I compared the strange and
anxious feelings that children have to face as they grow up to a "doll"
that seems to be on the brink of life and death. Maybe we are still
living in a reality that is unstable due to the gap between our
childhood and the world. In a world that changes day by day, let's leave
fear to a plastic doll named Carol without any emotion and live a
brighter and more powerful life.</p>
