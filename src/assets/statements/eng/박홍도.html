<p>I am very interested in humans. I watch and observe the facial
expressions or the looks of my friends or people passing by on the
street, and the slight changes in their appearances and expressions.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Not only the outward expressions but inside expressions as well.
Imagining and interpreting the expressions of the people or the thoughts
of a third person, I think a lot about ‘under what circumstances they
happened and in what kinds of situations they would feel this or that
emotion or speak or act this or that way. Observe other people's facial
expressions, etc.</p>
<p>The faces I worked on this time express animal expressions mainly of
human eyes. I started working on it, thinking that it was an expression
that came out of a moment I don't usually see.</p>
<p>For example, I chose the expression that appeared in the moment when
they looked at each other animalistically at their first meeting. ‘Where
can I see, what kind of person are you, and what are you doing?’ This
feeling may be a simple expression of the unconscious, but I think it is
an animalistic expression and eyes.</p>
<p>The human face will be different inside and outside. Think different.
Rather, I think that you may or may not have the idea that the internal
and external facial expressions and emotions are completely opposite.
You won't even know the person who accepted it. What kind of emotion did
‘I’ have on the inside and how did she make an outward expression. It
seems impossible to know human expressions. Doubt and doubt them,
explore and explore them.</p>
