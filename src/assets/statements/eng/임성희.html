<p>Where will the desire for something that cannot be achieved by human
power go to? From time immemorial, humans used to pass the role to
mysterious beings that resembled animals. Mysterious white tigers in the
mountains, dragons that came out in my dreams to tell me good luck. Or
auspicious animals that looked like a combination of them were born with
hopes and wishes.</p>
<p>However, over time, they were dismissed as illogical and
superstitious and remained remnants of totemism. So where did all the
good wishes for them go when they disappeared? Didn’t humans lose
imagination and hopes for realms that they cannot be sure about with
their efforts alone? The work begins from this question.</p>
<p>Indeed, if human desires and minds create things and they are
embodied in reality, what are they that exist beside us in the modern
era? Things such as fear of crime, boredom of labor, and desire for luck
still exist with a tremendous power to create new forms. I drew things
that would be born like that. The monsters that have emerged with those
roles arouse another desire to see if there are such creatures as match
my wishes somewhere. Isn't it quite pleasant to think, even if it's just
a moment’s absurd imagination, that there are monsters somewhere that
can fulfill your wishes that have not been discovered yet?</p>
