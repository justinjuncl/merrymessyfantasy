<p>Why did they make a Vanity and what was its original purpose? They
say it was designed for everyday use such as grooming, applying makeup,
doing your hair, and generally aiding you in looking your best every
day. But why do we need to look our best if we don’t feel our best?
There’s no denying that there is an urgent need to conceal not just our
physical appearance, but also our pain, our suffering, and our anxieties
in order to be accepted into today’s society. We live in a world where
physical appearance and beauty seem to rule over many inner features and
virtues like generosity, altruism, and forgiveness.</p>
<p>The word ‘vanity’ can be traced back to the Latin word ‘vanus’,
meaning futile, empty or useless. How can beauty, one of the things many
people deem most important, come in relation to an object that is, by
definition; pointless? Every single morning, I sit in front of my vanity
and stare at my face in the mirror. “What do I need to cover up today?”
or “who do I need to become?” I think, and then proceed to use cosmetic
products to attempt to manipulate people’s eyes into seeing what I want
them to see: Someone I’m most certainly not.</p>
<p>I wanted to explore the nature of identity and beauty by focusing on
the physical appearance and the diversity of humanity. Dating back to
the ancient Egyptians, the vanity is an object used by millions of
people around the world, people from different backgrounds and cultures.
I believe the constant question of beauty unites us as one, and the
vanity encompasses it all.</p>

<p>This is an audio-visual work that explores the feeling of
unsettlement and dread through music and art. To me, dread almost feels
like I’m about to lose everything and not know it.</p>
<p>In my mind lives a certain melody that has followed me around for
many years. It’s a melody that I can instantly recognize, even if its
choppy or distorted. Every time I hear it, my whole body freezes, and it
feels like nothing is real. Like nonstop anxiety that continues to grow
until I am left feeling empty and disoriented. It fascinates me that
something intangible like a simple melody can make people feel so
vulnerable in just a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The tune of the melody causes a reflection of life, a long past that
we live. We only exist because we remember: we are our memories. I tried
to portray this concept by painting 81 scenes that instill a sense of
dread through people’s eyes.</p>
